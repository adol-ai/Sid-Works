Who is Allah ? 
Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;  Allah, the Eternal, Absolute;   He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;  And there is none like unto Him.
Quran 112 : 1-4

. Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them for He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).

Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.
Quran 2 : 255, 256

''' And your God is one God  : there is no god but He ''''
Quran 2 : 163

'' Say : I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides God ''' 
Quran 6 : 56

''' Call not upon anyone with God......... Say, I  call upon God only and I do not associate anyone with Him  .'''' 
Quran 72 : 18-20 

O my servants, who have acted extravagantly against their own souls, do not despair of the Mercy of God , for God forgives Sins altogether, for He is the Forgiving , the Merciful '' quran, 39 : 53.

And ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him. Surely my Lord is Merciful, Loving~kind '' Quran 11 : 90

''' And He is the Forgiving , the Loving '''
Quran 85 : 15 .

''The Islamic belief in god is not a mere article of faith~a solitary item in a shadowy creed. It is deep rooted and firm.It has been frequently said Islam possesses the shortest creed of all the religions of the world, and though this may be the case, so firmly fixed is the Muslim' s belief in the Supreme Being that he regards with abhorrence and as blasphemy any attempt to divide in any way the Unity of God. How can the Divine Being be reduced to the  level of any other ? Or how can He share His Attributes with another ? He is the Most High and He Alone is to be adored, and to assert that there are three , or even two, in possession of Omnipotence is , to the Muslim , a self evident contradiction. 
''' There is a majestic glory in the expressions , Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem which cannot be found in any other words. No limits can circumscribe His beneficence. Is it a matter for wonderment that the Muslim  , when he thinks of the all embracing grace and beneficence , the Majesty and Glory of the Lord of all Existence , should prostrate himself with forehead on earth in adoration and worship ? To that Lord of All the Worlds , the Muslim gives a name which is above every other name, i e , the name of ALLAH , a name which has never been given  to any except the only true God , a name which embraces all the excellent names which can be enumerated. 
''' Islam is no mere creed , it is a life to be lived. In the Quran may be found directions for what are sometimes termed the minor details of daily life , but which are not minor when it is considered that life has to be lived for God. The muslim lives for God alone. God is the centre of all satisfaction , all hope , all life. The aim of the muslim is to become God ~bound ,  and to endeavour to advance the knowledge of God in all his undertakings. From the cradle to the grave , the true Muslim lives for God and God alone. '''

'' And be steadfast in worship and pay the poor rate. And whatever good you send before for yourselves , you will find it with God. Surely God is seer of what you do ''
Quran 2 : 110 

22. Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

23. Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him

24. He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.. ( Quran 59: 22 - 24 )

Say, My prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are surely for Allah,  the Lord of the Worlds. No associate has He. And this am I commanded , and I am the first of those who submit . '' Quran~ 6 : 163-164. 

.The Messenger believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord, as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers. "We make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His messengers." And they say: "We hear, and we obey: (We seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys."
Quran  2 : 285

( Those people , mainly Christians, who think that in Islam, God is Not a Loving God, should Ponder over these verses of the Glorious Quran . )

(Islam means  Equality And Anti - Racism) 

1. "O mankind! We...made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other)." (The Qur'an 49:13)

2. "He who sleeps on a full stomach whilst his neighbour goes hungry is not one of us." (Prophet Muhammad)

3. "...man can have nothing but what he strives for." (The Qur'an 53:39)

4. "A believer wants for his brother what he wants for himself." (Prophet Muhammad)

5. "O People, regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds." (The last Sermon of Prophet Muhammad)

6. "All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black, nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action." (The last Sermon of Prophet Muhammad)

7. Where do you find Paradise? The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “ Paradise is at the feet of the mother.”

This is variously interpreted to mean that the mother is responsible for teaching her children their religious obligations and good behaviour that will win them Paradise; or it may mean that we earn Paradise by serving our mother throughout her life.

Either way, it shows the great esteem, honour and respect that Islam has for mothers. While the fourth Commandment in the Bible is “Honour thy father and thy mother”, the Bible does not mention the mother separately as deserving good treatment.

The Qur’an, in contrast, gives special recognition to the mother’s suffering in bearing and nursing her child: “And We have enjoined on man to be good to his parents: In travail upon travail did his mother bear him and in two years was his weaning. Show gratitude to Me and to your parents” (31:14). 

Women are more psychologically fitted to nurturing, more compassionate and patient.

8. And he also said, " The parable of the Believers in their affection , mercy and compassion for each other is that of a body . When any limb aches, the whole body reacts with sleeplessness and fever. 

70. We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favours, above a great part of our creation
( Quran 17: 70)

Say, ''' I bear witness that , There is no god but Allah and I bear witness that the Prophet Muhammad , peace be upon him, is the Final Messenger of Allah.'''''

Similarities between Hinduism Islam 
1. Definition of a Hindu
The word Hindu has geographical significance and was used originally for those people who lived beyond the river Sindhu or the region watered by the river Indus. Some historians say that it was first used by the Persians who came to India through the north western passes of the Himalayas. The word Hindu is no where mentioned in Indian literature or scriptures before the advent of Muslims to India, according to the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. According to Jawaharlal Nehru in the book Discovery of India on page 74-75, he writes that the earliest reference to the word Hindu can be traced to a tantrik of the 8th Century CE, where it means a people and not a follower of a particular religion. The use of the word Hindu in connection with a particular religion is of late occurrence.
In short Hindu is a geographical definition used for the people living beyond the river Indus or those living in India
2. Definition of Hinduism
a) Hinduism has been derived from the word Hindu. Hinduism was a name given in English language in the Nineteenth Century by the English people to the multiplicity of the beliefs and faith of the people of the Indus land. According to New Encyclopedia Britannica 20:581. The British writers in 1830 gave the word Hinduism to be used as the common name for all the beliefs of the people of India excluding the Muslims and converted Christians.
b) The term Hinduism is misleading because though it suggests the unified system of beliefs and ideas, it is certainly not the case. Hinduism is too broad a phenomenon to be confined to a usual definitions of religions. It does not owe its origin, formation or finalization to any historical person or a prophet since there is no uniformly accepted belief sacraments, rituals and practices in Hinduism, there are no criteria for establishing rules in Hinduism. In short a person who calls himself a Hindu becomes a true practicing Hindu irrespective who he worships and what ever may be his beliefs and practice.
c) According to the Hindu scholars Hinduism is a misnomer and it should be referred a Sanatana Dharma, meaning eternal religion or Vedic Dharma meaning religion of the Veda. According to Swami Vivekananda the followers of this religion is referred as Vedantist.
B. Introduction of Islam
1. Definition of Islam
Islam is an Arabic word which comes from the word ‘Salaam’ which means ‘Peace’. It also means submitting your will to Allah – the Almighty God. In short Islam means peace acquired by submitting your will to Allah (SWT).
2. Definition of a Muslim
A Muslim is a person who submits his will to Allah – the Almighty God.
3. Misconception about Islam
Many people have a misconception that Islam is a new religion which came into existence 1400 years ago and Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the founder of the religion of Islam. Infact Islam is there since time immemorial, since man set foot on the earth. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is not the founder of the religion of Islam but he is the last and final messenger of Islam.
II. Pillars of Faith (Imaan) – Pillars of Hinduism
Pillars of Faith in Hinduism are not defined. As mentioned earlier that Hinduism does not have a set of unified or codified beliefs. Neither does it have any fixed pillars or principles which are obligatory for its followers to practice. A Hindu has a freedom to

===============================
Five Before Five
The Prophet ﷺ advised to:

“Take benefit of five before five: Your youth before your old age, your health before your sickness, your wealth before your poverty, your free time before you are preoccupied, and your life before your death”

(Narrated by Ibn Abbas and reported by Al Hakim)

Your Youth
When were are young we have strength, enthusiasm and drive and putting those advantages in the path of Allah raises the individual levels.

The Prophet ﷺ has told us that a young person who grew up with the worship of Allah, will be among the seven who are granted shade by Allah when there no shade but His.

(Bukhari)

Your Health
No one can guarantee what tomorrow will bring. Our health is a blessing from Allah that we tend to take for granted.

The Prophet ﷺ said,

“Whosoever begins the day feeling family security and good health; and possessing provision for his day is as though he possessed the whole world.”

[At- Tirmidhi].

Your Wealth
We should all have some part of our wealth to invest in the hereafter. Helping the needy, providing for orphans etc. all these secure a spot for us in Jannah.

Allah has promised us that he will repay us more than whatever sum of money we spend for His sake:

Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned.

(Quran 2:245)

“The feet of the son of Adam shall not move from before his Lord on the Day of Judgement, until he is asked about five things one of which is his wealth and how he earned it and spent it upon…  

(Al-Tirmidhi)

Your Free Time
Wasting time on idle things is not recommended in Islam. We should try to always fill our free time in the remembering  Allah and being productive.

The Prophet (ﷺ) said,

“There are two blessings which many people lose: (They are) Health and free time for doing good.”

(Bukhari)

Your Life before Death
We are all going to die, It is an inevitable truth. And how we spend this life in Dunya(this world) determines our life in the hereafter.

Take advantage of your life before it is too late…

“If you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their Lord, [saying], “Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness. Indeed, we are [now] certain.”

(Quran 32:12)

May Allah bless us with all five so we can work harder to please Him!

Spread this message where ever do you want like comments, whatsapp, etc to get the reward of sharing.  JazakAllah khairun

Abu Mas’ud reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Whoever guides someone to goodness will have a reward like one who did it.”

JESUS CHRIST (PEACE & BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM) IS SLAVE OF GOD.

"I have not come on my own; God sent me."
[John 8:42]
As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
[Mark 10:17-18]
Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been taught?”
Jesus answered, “ My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me .
Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him . Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”
[John 7:16-18]
Jesus gave them this answer:"..................Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life....... By myself I can do nothing ; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me .If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who testifies in my favor , and I know that his testimony about me is true......For the works that the Father has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me.And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form , nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent....."
[John 5:19-37]
Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me .
[John 14:24]
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all ; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
[John 10:29]
"You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I .
[John 14:28]
After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: ".....Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."
[John 17:1-3]
Jesus called himself 'servant' (of God).
'servant' was replaced by 'son'.
He called God as 'Lord'.
'Lord' was replaced by 'Father'.
This can be proven by Matthew 23:9.
'Father' does not fit there.
Only 'Lord' fits there.
"Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God amongst you"
—Peter, the leader of disciples appointed by Jesus before he left
[Acts 2:22]
The word εἰς (eis) can also means 'to' other than 'amongst' as NRSV & NIV translate it. But 'to' does not not fit there.
"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus."
—Peter, the leader of disciples appointed by Jesus before he left
[Acts 3:13]
The word Παῖδα (paida) means 'servant'.
Disciples of Jesus called him 'Master'.
The word Κύριον (Kyrion) can mean both 'Lord' or 'Master'. It means 'Master' there but it is mistranslated as 'Lord'.
JESUS WAS NOT CRUCIFIED
All the disciples of Jesus foresook him & fled acc. to Matthew 26:56 & Mark 14:50 [[*69* *Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard*, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.
70 But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.
71 Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
72 He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
73 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
74 Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!”
(Matthew 26)
Matthew 26:69 says Peter was sitting in the courtyard. There is no mention of Peter after that means he stopped following from there.]]. All the knowledge they had was from what they heard. They had heard that Master Jesus was crucified, that he had died, he had given out the spirit.
When Jesus came they were terrified (Luke 24:36,37) . Jesus told them, "Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” (Luke 24:39) .
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement " (Luke 24:40,41) .
To prove again that he was not a spirit, that he was not a resurrected body, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence. ("Luke 24:41-43)
Jesus showed his disciples nothing happened to him (John 20:20) . Those disciples who Jesus told Thomas that they saw him. Thomas did not believe nothing happened to him. (John 20:24,25)
Thomas said,“Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.” (John 20:25)
Jesus came & told Thomas to check himself nothing happened to him. Jesus said to Thomas,"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” (John 20:27)
When Thomas saw that nothing happened to Jesus he exclaimed, "My Lord & My God". (John 20:28) Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” (John 20:29)
Noone dies for anyone's sins.

The one who sins is the one who will die.
[Ezekiel 18:4]
Salvation ?

Say, (O Prophet, that God says) "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves (by sinning), do not despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is The Forgiving, The Merciful."
[Qur'aan 39:53]
