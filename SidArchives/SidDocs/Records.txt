Water Fast Day 1 ~~~ Workout Day 5 ~~~ 8th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:30 AM and Finished my Fajr Salah...I don't know why? but it felt very Tired...No,thought of Running and Workin 
out for the day...But when Aaman made a phone call at the noon, As usual talks about the plans of the day...Which kinda 
gave a indirect hope or motivation... My conscience was like "Why don't you Give it a Try?"...So I started my session but I 
felt More energitic than Yesterday and finish my routine Workouts Duration over 2hrs to 2&1/2hrs, varies every day as per 
my Condition...Point to be Noted "There was no Hunger after the workouts but before the workout Felt I hunger"... and 
day passed on YouTube...Clock nearing 6PM:it was quite boring...So i decided to Finish my running for the day... 
Surprisingly I ran over 24 Laps segregated with 3 sets[15,6,3] in the Basement which is 5 laps greater than yesterday... I 
couldn't Believe I did it while Fast...and then climbing stairs for 4 Laps for 5 storeys... I conclude that Day1 felt Very 
COOL!

Water Fast Day 2 ~~~ Boxing Class Day 1 ~~~ 9th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:03 AM and finished my Fajr Salah...Reached Stadium around 6:10 AM... and went a Jog-2(1/2) rounds outside 
the stadium(Road)... and Started the Class then... after a few shadow Boxing and started the Long Heavy HIIT workout of 3 
sets!... I was completely Exshausted!!!...and then Strengtening Stuff then Warm down... I state that "This is the Heaviest 
& Draining workout Ever done in my life"... and then back home at 9:30 AM... Which eventually made me to take a nap around 
3 hrs which I don't use to!...Then spent some time on Documentaries... eventually I couldn't hit my basement Running and 
routine Workout!... This is me hitting hard on me... that my day seems like incomplete!!!... I conclude that Day2 is the 
exact Opposite of Day1!

Water Fast Day 3 ~~~ Boxing Class Day 2 ~~~ Workout Day 6 ~~~ 10th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:00 AM and finished my Fajr Salah...Reached the Stadium around 6:10 AM... and Jogged for the same count... It 
seemed suspisious while the Corparation Spraying Disinfecter everywhere ... but didn't mind it... then Warm up stuff and 
the moment when we were in the quater way in Shadow boxing session and hoping to start the Sparing ofr the day as planned... 
A Cop made an entery stating "The spread is kinda peaking the city... So please Backup!"... My conscience was like "Oh Man, 
you missed an Opportunity" but Myself: "Thank God, So I wouldn't miss my routine Workouts and basement running!"... so back 
home at 7:40 AM and watching some News then then took a Nap!... Time passed on... Then started my routine workout around 
4:00 PM .. I felt very Weak at the start but, As Duruation passed I felt more energetic ... then spent some time on Netflix 
and here Iam... I conclude that Day3 isn't As worse as Day2... It Felt Better!

Water Fast Day 4 ~~~ Workout Day 7 ~~~ 11th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:20 AM and Pushed the alarm stop botton, Notice a missed call from my friend who don't use to calls me rarely... 
which is completely Skeptical... then I made a call to Aaman to wake him up as usual...the moment he picked the call he 
just blow me up!... Stating "The appartment where I live... Is been contaminated and the zone is been sealed by the Police!"... 
I just rushed to my Mom & Dad and then realized it the Appartment with the same name Three signals nearby... but still it 
is freaking me out...and then i finished my Fajr Salah...and decided to skip my running...then took a nap... day passed on 
and started my routine workout around 3:00 PM and I have to mention that I haven't eaten anything for past 3 Days... I 
tried my best but I couldn't pass on to my Pushup Portion... So I did Quit... It was to Exshausting from the Start till the 
End... It was a Absolute Torture!...This actually me to Count over the Days!...And my mind dreaming alot having a Full 
Grill Chicken To Break the Fast At Day 7!... It's Frustarating!... Then as usual spent time on Netflix and here Iam... I 
conclude that This Day4 is kinda as same as Day2...It's Gross!

Water Fast Day 5 ~~~ Workout Day 8 ~~~ 12th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:30 AM and finished my Fajr Salah... Then took a Nap... then Spent some time on Youtube... Started my routine
workout around 4:00 PM... I felt Half motivated & Half Hopeless Today... My problem is: Oneside, Family forcing me to Quit!
and Otherside, Me-Myself Controlling My Temptations!... "It's A Hardship!"... but today my mind didn't desire to have any 
Grills or Shawarmas... I hope this Continues... Just 2 Days left,after been'in alot of circumstances... I conclude that 
Day5 is kinda 50:50...It isn't Wrose and isn't Great!

Water Fast Day 6 ~~~ Workout Day 9 ~~~ 13th June 2020:
Woke up at 5:00 AM and finished my Fajr Salah... Then took a Nap... Started my workout around 9:30 AM... Just looking 
over my back that i have I have crossed alot of mountains and wondering that only one day is left!... but still my mind 
is dreaming about the food I wanna Desire!...Uf... I firmly believe that "Each and Every Hard work Pays Off!"... I have 
to push myself to my Limits until I reach my Destination... So I Conclude that Day6, which wanna state "IAM Used To It!"
and Thats It...

Water Fast Day 7 ~~~ Workout Day 10 ~~~ 14th June 2020:
Last night, I was struggling to Sleep... It's usual but yesterday night was horrible... so today I couldn't even wake up 
Fajr... Just Woke up around 10:00 AM... Started my Workout around 11:30 AM... Sooo this is the Last Day for my Water Fast 
... It an Amazing experience in my Life... Alot of Pain, Hunger, Sweat, Hardships... Iam Very Strong bot Mentally & 
Physically... Iam in my Best Shape since my Childhood... I lost over 7-8 Kgs througout the journey In the rate of 1Kg 
per Day!... I know it's unbelievable! but it is... I even don't remember the taste of food right now... Right now i could 
even indulge myself with Green vegies and I feel I could have it Forever... This thing has really changed me alot!... 
I have learned the Complete Self Control Stuff!... This is a Turning Point!... Over Thousands of people Die every day due 
to hunger!... but Millons of Tons of Food are thrown every day!... It's Frustrating... "You Know It When You Feel It!"... 
Each and every Person in this land should Fast for atleast 5 Days... Because thr people who can affort food feel the Food 
is UnderRated... Everyone should learn the lesson that we Earn to have food, Not to Indulge or Waste Food... I Aspire to 
feed as much as people in I could!... "One Day We must eradicate Poverty Forever! Together"... Hoping for the Best 
Inshallah

From The Fast Aspect I Say "Just Do It!"...But Disclaimer: Definitely you have to Workout Atleast for 1&1/2 Hrs else You 
won't be the same, You couldn't Get Off the Bed!
